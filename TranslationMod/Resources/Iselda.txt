ISELDA_GREET1 : We have chosen this city in all places. I thought he was standing a short time, then my husband sang this old destruction. Now she is wasting her time. This is a loud voice, but who bought it without it?
ISELDA_TRAMPIN : Can most of the caming be naked? It does not make any difference to me, to supply the high line provided by the Korean. However, I have made the battery to open the room. You can use it if you want to create a complete list of features. <Page> It's not hard to do so, so I'm sorry to pay it.
ISELDA_NOSTOCK : After more stock? I bought a lot of love. Unfortunately, this is clear, you have nothing to sell.
ISELDA_NEW_MAP : ISELDA_NEW_MAP
ISELDA_DREAMTREE : My husband said that the royal secret in the royal court had suggested I inject him to mark it. <Page> Cornifer looks a little sad at the corner of the picture, and he thinks it's coming, but I think it's fine. Who wants to get a strong needle?
ISELDA_CORNIFER_HOME : Karnipharera about the result, but he came home, he was starving. He will always do that job, and anger after the end of the show, and then he fell. <Home>, with her family, and I think a little sleep helps, I still miss the company. I love made a mistake, and also his mistakes. and his passion for inspiration cards. Karni said, I always refused to join. Maybe next time I will accept the offer?
ISELDA_MEET : Your site's map is available? That's what you're talking about, but only! It's less. He'll come back to bring new bugs to the store, but I want to spend a good time. I do not have a shop. We can afford to buy something.
ISELDA_REPEAT : You are in the woods? Sometimes My Halloween writes as a mirror, but sometimes it seems to be a dangerous and dangerous part.
ISELDA_GHOSTPIN : Corny told me about the graves and temple of Britain. I tried to represent them in my new style. </ P> <b> Why is it so hard, I work on the information. This is a good result, so I think I am entitled to a bit more.
ISELDA_DREAM : I am happy to leave my hand. He made a peaceful life together, and Connie was happier than me. I wish it spread its legs ... soon ...
