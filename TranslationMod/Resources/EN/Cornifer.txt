FUNGAL_WASTES_GREET : Little friend, catch me. I mapped these caves. There are many types of equipment in the area. I always recommend a ban. They were like "leafy" people, like a child I was fighting in his cave, but I was afraid my body would fall.
GREENPATH_GREET : Is it different from the cross? The moisturizing and softening way is very steep.

FUNGAL_WASTES_BOUGHT : I suspect the smell of the cave. My body is very sensitive.
CLIFFS_GREET : Do you like hot summers? We are close to Halloween and only in the surrounding area. <page> This site is far from my destination.

FOG_CANYON_GREET : Yes Yes! Surprisingly, the level of terrifying wonders in these caves is completely new. Do you see the door in the dark? It can be annoying. I tried to get everything. Luckily I was a little rich, but I found another way.

FOG_CANYON_BOUGHT : There’s a big building in the middle of the lake, I want to do something amazing, but it’s hidden in this beautiful white nature. Oh they are so many ... great they give a good chance to mount the tobacco.

CORNIFER_INTRO_2 : My name is Carnifer. I love exploring the world. Why did I beat my mother's cousin for the first time? So my wife and I immediately drove to Dortmund.

WATERWAYS_GREET : Isn't the river Nilam attractive? There is a gap between the pipe and the tunnel. I couldn’t find a better place to use it for my energy. He was well-prepared, well-thought-out, and had nothing but uncertainty. I want to put a name on this sheet.
